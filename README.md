## Email Analysis and Classification for SPAM Detection ##
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying emails to identify SPAM and extract key insights from the data. 

The main objectives of the project are:
1. __Train a Classifier__ : Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify emails as SPAM or NOT SPAM.
2. __Topic Identification__: Analyze the content of SPAM emails to identify the main topics or recurring themes
3. __Semantic Analysis__: Calculate the semantic distance between identified topics to evaluate their similarity.

__Features__
- *Data Preparation*: Load, clean, and preprocess email datasets to prepare them for analysis.
- *Model Training*: Utilize supervised learning techniques to build a robust SPAM detection classifier.
- *Topic Modeling*: Use natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify and group similar topics within SPAM emails.
- *Semantic Distance Calculation*: Employ techniques to measure the similarity between topics, aiding in deeper understanding of email patterns.

__Tools and Libraries__
- *Core Libraries*: pandas, numpy, and collections for data manipulation and analysis.
- *Visualization*: Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for exploratory data analysis and visual representation of findings.
- *Machine Learning and NLP*: Frameworks for building and evaluating the SPAM classifier and topic models.
